# Project 1 - Flicks

**Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I thought the process of setting up the refresh control and loading data from the api was rather confusing and took a lot of tinkering around to get right. 
   I'm still not sure I entirely understand what I did, but it seems to work.
2. The process of setting up the table view is still not entirely clear to me, though I understand the code from the tutorial if I look at it, I'm not sure I have a good understanding
   of how it works exactly.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Please refer to the two areas of further discussion above for the main difficulties.
Also, some Swift syntax still confuses me despite the walkthroughs. Many times I find myself allowing
Xcode to correct me, not fully understanding the reasoning behind it.

# Project 2 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How exactly does the programmatic setting of the tab view controller work
2. I still don't have a good grasp of optionals/nils

## Notes

Many of the challenges were in troubleshooting errors that occured as a result of the tutorials differing from the current version of swift. I don't think my grasp of some of the fundamentals was strong enough to effectively handle this.
